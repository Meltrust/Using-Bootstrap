                  "We can't foresee a time when America would run out of meat,"
                  Sarah Little, vice president of communications at the North
                  American Meat Institute told Newsweek. "We have reserves in
                  cold storage and we have the most abundant livestock supply in
                  the world—so much so that we export meat."
